q1.main( )
{
 int i = -4, j, num ;
 j = ( num < 0 ? 0 : num * num ) ;
 printf ( "\n%d", j ) ;
}
Answer - 0/garbage value. 
Explaination- We evaluate here if num<0, and since there is no value assigned to it, it goes into the else part. num*num. depending on the compiler it will return either a garbage value or will return 0. But it is because of the else condition. 

Q2- main( )
{
 int k, num = 30 ;
 k = ( num > 5 ? ( num <= 10 ? 100 : 200 ) : 500 ) ;
 printf ( "\n%d", num ) ;
} 
Answer - 30
Explaination - Here num is greater than 5 and so it gets into if condition where further it is evaluated. but number is greater than 10 and it goes into the else part. k gets assigned the value of 200. However, since we are printing num, the output will be 30.

Q3 - main( )
{
 int j = 4 ;
 ( !j != 1 ? printf ( "\nWelcome") : printf ( "\nGood Bye") ) ;
 Answer - Welcome
 Explaination - The unary operator is evaluated. since 4 is a non-zero value it is true, and the negative of it will be false or 0. This makes the condition to go into the if part and welcome is printed.
