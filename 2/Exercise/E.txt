Question 1- /* This program
/* is an example of
/* using Logical operators */
main( )
{
 int i = 2, j = 5 ;
 if ( i == 2 && j == 5 )
 printf ( "\nSatisfied at last" ) ;
} 
Answer - There is no error in this code. the if condition evaluates to true, and Satisfied at last is printed. 

Q2 - main( )
{
 int code, flag ;
 if ( code == 1 & flag == 0 )
 printf ( "\nThe eagle has landed" ) ;
}
Answer - There is no syntatical error in this code. In this case, code and flag are not assigned any value, making them having a garbage value or non-zero value. The if statement is binded by an and statement, the first of which becomes false. 

Q3 - main( )
{
 char spy = 'a', password = 'z' ;
 if ( spy == 'a' or password == 'z' )
 printf ( "\nAll the birds are safe in the nest" ) ;
}
Answer - This will fail because the code for or operator in c is ||. 

Q4 - main( )
{int i = 10, j = 20 ;
 if ( i = 5 ) && if ( j = 10 )
 printf ( "\nHave a nice day" ) ;
}
Answer - You will get an error in this code. This because you cannot bind two if statements with a conditional operator. The right equation would be - if (i==5 && j==20).

Q5 - main( )
{
 int x = 10 , y = 20;
 if ( x >= 2 and y <=50 )
 printf ( "\n%d", x ) ;
}
Answer - You will get an error here, the symbol for and is && in C. 

Q6 - main( )
{
 int a, b ;
 if ( a == 1 & b == 0 )
 printf ( "\nGod is Great" ) ;
}
Answer - Here since a and b are not provided any value, they contain either garbage value or non-zero value. and so the if condition fails. 

Q7 - main( )
{
 int x = 2;
 if ( x == 2 && x != 0 ) ;
 {
 printf ( "\nHi" ) ;
 printf( "\nHello" ) ;
 }
 else
 printf( "Bye" ) ;
} 
Answer - The if statement in this code has an ; making the statement complete. the else statement cannot exist without an if statement. Since there is a ; after if, as per compiler the if statement is complete. This causes error. 

Q8 - main( )
{
 int i = 10, j = 10 ;
 if ( i && j == 10)
 printf ( "\nHave a nice day" ) ;
 }
 Answer - There is no error in this code. The and operator is evaluated 10 && 10 results in 10 and this is then compared with 10, fulfilling the if condition.
